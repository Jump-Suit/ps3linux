# ps3linux

This is the backup of the ps3linux directory from gitorious.ps3dev.net. Unfortunately Gitorious is no more. So what we try here is to preserve what was left before the site went down.

## abstract

Browse the repository and watch carefully what you're looking for.

Unfortunately patches for the PS3 kernel tree https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geoff/ps3-linux.git seem to stop with version 3.16.

Feel free to contribute so that we may provide newer kernel patches in the future!

## motivation

We are still trying to program internally for the Cell Broadband Engine. It's a side project.
Thus from time to time we'll bring back stuff online we used in the past. Also docs are planned.
Also, plans for publishing our stuff in the near future are under construction.

## contact

Feel free to drop us a line anytime: info[at]aethyx[dot]eu or info[at]zockerseele[dot]com

Thanks and have a good time! :-)
