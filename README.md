# ps3linux - an independent repository for PS3 Linux & Cell development

---

![Alt text](https://aethyx.eu/wp-content/uploads/linuxonps3.jpg?raw=true "PS3 Linux FTW!")

---

This repository started with a backup of the ps3linux directory left from `gitorious.ps3dev.net`. Unfortunately Gitorious is no more. So what we try here is to preserve what was left before the site shut down.

But there is more.

Secondly, PS3 developers will also find the following inside this repository:

* Debian 8 packages of the Cell SDK 3.1 as well as
* all what was left on the YDL ISO regarding SPU and PPU development, now as Debian 8 packages
* all what was once left by the Barcelona Supercomputing Center regarding official Cell development, also as Debian 8 packages

## Abstract

Browse the repository and watch carefully what you're looking for. Sometimes there exist README.md files, read them thoroughly.

Unfortunately patches for the official kernel tree seem to stop with version 3.16. But these shouldn't be needed anymore.

There exists a PS3 kernel tree still today: [https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geoff/ps3-linux.git](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geoff/ps3-linux.git "https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/geoff/ps3-linux.git") maintained by Geoff Levand.
Be aware that due to a ABI bug the most recent kernel is 3.15 you may use on your own PS3 Linux machine (status: December 2017).

Feel free to contribute!

## Motivation

We at AETHYX MEDIAE are still trying to program internally for the Cell Broadband Engine. It's a side project.
Thus, from time to time we'll bring back stuff online we used in the past. Also docs and developer files are planned.
Thirdly, plans for publishing our stuff in the near future are under (heavy) construction.
